SOM
===

This is a result of a Research Project made in 2014 in UTN FRD Argentina (Universidad Tecnologica Nacional Facultad Regional Delta).

## Getting Started

### Environment setting

We are using Python and Scipy packages.
We've found that all-in-one installer are the easiest and simpler to install.

- Download and Install [Entought Canopy Free](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/).
- Download and Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download)


And you are all set!


> Other options include [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads), but
use Entought Canopy to promote smooth team work.

### Getting Started

Make you sure you have git installed, open `git bash` in windows (or a regular terminal in Linux / Unix system) and type:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/franleplant/SOM SOM
cd SOM
```

## Docs

We are going to be using Scipy heavily, please refer to
[Scipy Docs](http://www.scipy.org/docs.html).
Scipy is a Python meta-package that includes other Scientific and Mathematics packages, the most important are:

- [Numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/): Fast N-Array package.
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html): Comprehensive 2D Plotting
- [Scipy itself](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/): Fundamental library for scientific computing
- Others
